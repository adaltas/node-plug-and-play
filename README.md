# Node.js PlugAndPlay package

Easily create hooks and let users plug their own logic across your code to make it extensible by everyone with new features.

## Main features

  Simple to declare new extention points, yet a lot of flexibility to the plugin authors.
* Hook definition   
  Plugin writer can intercept calls to a function by placing their own logicl before, after and even switching the default implementation.
* Dependency management   
  Plugins can require other plugins as required dependencies as well as choose the order of execution of each hook.
* Promise support   
  Hook can be synchronous and asynchronous when returning a promise.
* Nested/hierachical
